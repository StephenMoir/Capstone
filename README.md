Need to cover
The project's domain background — the field of research where the project is derived;
A problem statement — a problem being investigated for which a solution will be defined;
The datasets and inputs — data or inputs being used for the problem;
A solution statement — the solution proposed for the problem given;
A benchmark model — some simple or historical model or result to compare the defined solution to;
A set of evaluation metrics — functional representations for how the solution can be measured;
An outline of the project design — how the solution will be developed and results obtained.



Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error and "worst" or largest (mean of the three
largest values) of these features were computed for each image,
resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field
13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

All feature values are recoded with four significant digits.

Missing attribute values: none

Class distribution: 357 benign, 212 malignant
